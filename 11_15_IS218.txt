*args will accept any number of parameters and convert them into a tuple
and that tuple can be iterated over 

def concatenate(**kwargs):
	result = ""
	for arg in kwargs.values():
		result += arg
return result 

**kwargs takes any number of parameters, and turns them into a dictionary
a dictionary is an unordered and mutuable python container that stores mappings 
of unique keys to values

tuple is a list that cant be changed (cant add to it or modify values)

a list is a list of items with integer keys that can be changed
