high level vision will be the end product
transforms the way volleyball players experience playing 
who and what is analyzing the key moments 

problem scenario storyboard
dont need to explain how they met and why they are playing 

should design for an intermediate player that would use the app 
make problem scenarios more realistic ex: player fucks up, someone else makes a remark instead of giving advice
think about how people in real life play volleyball

dont generate solutions for the problem scenarios
just identify relevant problems that people may experience

activity scenario has the solution
ex: in problem scenario, Matthew had fun playing volleyball and wished he recorded so his friends could see
in activity scenario, Matthew used the app and recorded and sent it to his friends

make wireframes more general
