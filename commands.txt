docker ps -a -q (deletes all stopped containers)
docker image rm <image name> (deletes image)
docker rename <old_container_name> <new_name> (renames container)
docker inspect <container_name>
docker pull <image_name> (fetches image from docker registry and saves it locally)

-s is short for --size(lists the size for each container)
-d is short for --detach (starts container in background and keeps running)
