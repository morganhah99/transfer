high-level vision:
	- media is inherently "sharable" 
 	- change the experience of playing, not the way they use technology
 
personas: 
	- make it realistic, add personality
	- smell test

storyboard: 
	- don't need to magically have the personas meet
	- there are certain things that people do that are good or bad, describe them
	- do we need all personas together? or do we do problem scenario based on individual experience of persona
	- problem scenarios aren't supposed to be manipulated for a specific problem, write about what actually happens
	- this is the normal social process and we want to intervene with the app
	- explain specific moves like "ankle breaker" that may occur in problem scenario

claims analysis: 
	- include something that happened in the problem scenario like an incident
